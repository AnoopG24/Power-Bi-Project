This Power BI project analyzes employee attrition trends to identify key factors influencing workforce turnover. Using an HR dataset containing demographics, compensation, satisfaction, and performance data, the dashboard visualizes insights across multiple dimensions such as department, job role, age group, salary slab, overtime, and work-life balance.
Key visuals include overall attrition rate, department-wise attrition, salary vs. attrition correlation, satisfaction-level analysis, and tenure-based retention trends. Interactive filters and KPIs allow dynamic exploration of high-risk employee segments.
The dashboard helps HR teams understand the primary drivers of attrition — including overtime, low satisfaction, limited growth, and long commute distances — enabling data-driven decisions to improve retention and employee engagement.
